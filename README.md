# RL's RocketPy sim

## What is this?
This is an extensive notebook that houses all of the simulations of our rockets.

## How do we use this?

Start by running

```bash
uv sync
```

If you are going to be converting an Open Rocket sim/rocket to RocketPy, you must download the .jar Open Rocket installer  
Note: You **MUST** get the .jar version that aligns with the Open Rocket that you made the .ork file in.  
<https://openrocket.info/downloads.html>

If you're going to convert an ork file, use

```bash
cd serializer
```

and open `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to continue with the conversion.

### **NAH** I won't be adding the .jar file in here bc it's too big, so **DEAL WITH IT**
