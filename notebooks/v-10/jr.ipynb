        "This Jupyter notebook provides a complete setup for simulating the flight of Jose's Rocket using the RocketPy library. The simulation is based on the data extracted from the OpenRocket XML file. The rocket is a single-stage high-power rocket with a fiberglass airframe, carbon fiber fins, and an AeroTech M2500T motor as the default configuration.\n",

        "- Launch site: Spaceport America (latitude 32.99, longitude -106.97, elevation 1400 m).\n",
        "- Atmospheric model: Standard atmosphere for simplicity (can be changed to forecast).\n",
        "- Drag coefficient: Constant 0.45 (approximate; can be replaced with a curve from OpenRocket if available).\n",
        "- Dry mass without motor: Approximately 18 kg (summed from components with approximations for shell masses).\n",
        "- Center of dry mass: Approximately 1.5 m from tail (estimated).\n",
