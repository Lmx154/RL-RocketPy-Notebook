    "Drag varies with Mach number due to:\n",
    "- **Subsonic (M < 0.9)**: primarily skin friction and form drag from body and fins\n",
    "- **Transonic (0.9 < M < 1.2)**: wave drag increases dramatically near M=1 due to shock formation\n",

    "### Applying CFD Analysis to Drag Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Flight Dynamics Team: How to Use CFD Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you obtain drag coefficients from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis, you need to understand what to simulate and how to apply the results to this flight simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Full Rocket CFD (Recommended for Accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to simulate:** \n",
    "- Complete rocket assembly including nose cone, body tube, fins, and boat tail as a single geometry\n",
    "- Run simulations across Mach numbers: 0.0, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 2.0, 3.0 (minimum)\n",
    "- Simulate both power-on (with exhaust plume) and power-off configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to apply results:**\n",
    "1. Extract total Cd values at each Mach number from CFD post-processing\n",
    "2. Create [Mach, Cd] pairs from your CFD data\n",
    "3. Replace the `cd_power_off` and `cd_power_on` arrays with your CFD results\n",
    "4. The rocket reference area is automatically calculated from `rocket_body_radius`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Most accurate - captures all interaction effects between components\n",
    "- Accounts for interference drag at fin-body and nose-body junctions\n",
    "- Includes base drag effects and wake interactions\n",
    "- No need to combine separate component drag values\n",
    "\n",
    "**CFD Setup Requirements:**\n",
    "- Include exhaust plume geometry/boundary condition for power-on case\n",
    "- Ensure proper boundary layer resolution (y+ < 1 for accurate skin friction)\n",
    "- Use compressible flow solver for transonic/supersonic regimes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Component-by-Component CFD (More Work, Educational)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to simulate:**\n",
    "- Nose cone alone (cone + cylindrical body section)\n",
    "- Fins alone (single fin or fin set on cylinder)\n",
    "- Boat tail alone (transition geometry)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to apply results:**\n",
    "If you choose this approach, you'll need to:\n",
    "1. Get Cd values for each component at each Mach number\n",
    "2. Calculate total Cd by **summing** component contributions (with caution)\n",
    "3. Apply correction factors for interference drag (typically 5-15% increase)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- **RocketPy already models individual surfaces** (nose cone, fins, tail) internally\n",
    "- The `cd_power_off` and `cd_power_on` arrays represent the **total rocket Cd**\n",
    "- If using component CFD, you're essentially validating/improving RocketPy's built-in models\n",
    "- Component drag values **do not add linearly** - you must account for:\n",
    "  - **Interference drag**: additional drag at component junctions\n",
    "  - **Mutual flow interaction**: fins affect body flow, nose affects fin flow\n",
    "  - **Wake effects**: upstream components affect downstream drag\n",
    "\n",
    "**This approach is NOT recommended** unless you're conducting detailed aerodynamic studies, because:\n",
    "- More simulations required (3-4× the computational cost)\n",
    "- Must manually combine results with interference factors\n",
    "- RocketPy's geometric methods already provide good component estimates\n",
    "- Full-rocket CFD gives better results with less effort\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Component Validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended workflow:**\n",
    "1. Run **full rocket CFD** to get total Cd values → use for flight simulation\n",
    "2. Run **component CFD** separately to validate and understand contributions\n",
    "3. Compare component CFD to RocketPy's internal component drag breakdown\n",
    "4. Use insights to refine rocket geometry for drag reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Drag Coefficients with CFD Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If your CFD analysis produces these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# CFD-derived drag coefficients (example data)\n",
    "cd_power_off_cfd = np.array([\n",
    "    [0.00, 0.42],  # Your CFD result at M=0.0\n",
    "    [0.50, 0.48],  # Your CFD result at M=0.5\n",
    "    [0.90, 0.54],  # Your CFD result at M=0.9\n",
    "    [1.00, 0.78],  # Your CFD result at M=1.0 (transonic peak)\n",
    "    [1.20, 0.63],  # Your CFD result at M=1.2\n",
    "    [2.00, 0.49],  # Your CFD result at M=2.0\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply replace the current `cd_power_off` array with your CFD data. The simulation will interpolate between your data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical CFD Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Area:**\n",
    "- Ensure your CFD Cd is based on **body cross-sectional area** (π × `rocket_body_radius`²)\n",
    "- RocketPy uses body area as reference, not fin area or wetted area\n",
    "- If your CFD uses a different reference area, convert: Cd_body = Cd_other × (A_other / A_body)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mach Number Range:**\n",
    "- Cover subsonic (M < 0.9), transonic (0.9-1.2), and supersonic (M > 1.2) regimes\n",
    "- Transonic region (M ≈ 1.0) shows highest drag - ensure fine resolution here\n",
    "- V-10 will likely experience M = 0 to ~2.5 during flight\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power-On vs Power-Off:**\n",
    "- **Power-on**: exhaust plume reduces base drag significantly (5-10% lower total Cd)\n",
    "- **Power-off**: larger wake region increases base drag\n",
    "- Model power-on with appropriate exhaust plume pressure/temperature boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:**\n",
    "- Compare CFD results to empirical methods (Barrowman, RASAero, OpenRocket)\n",
    "- Check that Cd increases dramatically at M ≈ 1.0 (wave drag)\n",
    "- Verify Cd decreases at higher supersonic Mach numbers\n",
    "- Transonic peak should be Cd ≈ 0.7-0.8 for typical rockets\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Drag Coefficients Status\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cd_power_off` and `cd_power_on` arrays currently contain **initial estimates** based on typical rocket aerodynamics. These should be replaced with CFD-derived values for accurate flight predictions."
